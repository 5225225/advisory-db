# `FixedCapacityDequeLike::clone()` can cause dropping uninitialized memory

Affected versions of this crate don't guard against panics, so that partially uninitialized buffer is dropped when user-provided `T::clone()` panics in `FixedCapacityDequeLike<T, A>::clone()`. This causes memory corruption.
