# `impl Sync for Bunch<T>` needs a Sync bound on T

Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implements `Sync` for `Bunch<T>`.
This allows users to insert `T: !Sync` to `Bunch<T>`. It is possible to create a data race to a `T: !Sync` by invoking the `Bunch::get()` API (which returns `&T`) from multiple threads.

Such data races can lead to memory corruption.
