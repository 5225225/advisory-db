# Intern<T>: Data race allowed on T

Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implements `Sync` for `Intern<T>`.
This allows users to create data race on `T: !Sync`, which may lead to undefined behavior
(for example, memory corruption).

The flaw was corrected in commit 2928a87 by adding the trait bound `T: Sync` in the `Sync` impl of `Intern<T>`.
