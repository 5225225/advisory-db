# Queues allow non-Send types to be sent to other threads, allowing data races

Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented `Send` for types used in queue implementations (`InnerSend<RW, T>`, `InnerRecv<RW, T>`, `FutInnerSend<RW, T>`, `FutInnerRecv<RW, T>`).

This allows users to send non-Send types to other threads, which can lead to data race bugs or other undefined behavior.
