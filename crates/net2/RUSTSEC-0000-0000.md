# `net2` invalidly assumes the memory layout of std::net::SocketAddr

The [`net2`](https://crates.io/crates/net2) crate has converted `std::net::SocketAddr`
instances into C `sockaddr` pointers simply by casting the pointer. This will cause
invalid memory access if/when the standard library ever changes the implementation.
No warnings or errors will be emitted once the change happens.

Please stop using `net2` completely (it's deprecated, use `socket2`) or at least
upgrade to version `0.2.36` where the socket address conversion is done safely.
