# misc::vec_with_size() can drop uninitialized memory if clone panics

`misc::vec_with_size` creates a vector of the provided `size` and immediately
calls `vec.set_len(size)` on it, initially filling it with uninitialized memory.
It then inserts elements using `vec[i] = value.clone()`.

If the `value.clone()` call panics, uninitialized items in the vector will be
dropped leading to undefined behavior.
