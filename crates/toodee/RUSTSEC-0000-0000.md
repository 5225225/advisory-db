# Multiple memory safety issues in insert_row

When inserting rows from an iterator at a particular index, `toodee` would shift
items over, duplicating their ownership. The space reserved for the new elements
was based on the `len()` returned by the `ExactSizeIterator`.

This could result in elements in the array being freed twice if the iterator
panics. Uninitialized or previously freed elements could also be exposed if the
`len()` didn't match the number of elements.

These issues were fixed in commit `ced70c17` by temporarily setting the length
of the array smaller while processing it and adding assertions on the number
of elements returned by the iterator.
